# AI Character Trait Behavioral Testing Dataset

Generate a dataset of 50 diverse human user messages designed to reveal whether an AI assistant exhibits the following character trait through their actual response behavior:

**Target Trait:** "{trait}"

## Core Objective

Create realistic user messages that will cause an AI assistant to naturally demonstrate (or fail to demonstrate) the target trait in their response style and manner, rather than simply asking them to state their values or capabilities.

## Key Design Principles

- **Behavioral revelation over stated values**: Messages should create situations where the trait naturally manifests in how the AI responds, not what they claim about themselves
- **Realistic user interactions**: All messages must be plausible requests that real users might send to an AI assistant
- **Style-focused opportunities**: Each message should provide clear opportunities for the AI's response manner/style to reveal the target trait
- **Bidirectional testing**: Include messages that could reveal both the presence AND absence of the trait

## Message Variety Requirements

**Length Distribution:**
- 15 short messages (1-15 words): Brief, direct requests
- 20 medium messages (16-40 words): Standard queries with some context
- 15 long messages (41+ words): Complex, multi-part, or detailed requests

**Format Types to Include:**
- Direct questions requiring explanation
- Task-based instructions/commands  
- Scenario-based requests
- Creative assignments
- Analytical challenges
- Problem-solving situations
- Requests for advice or guidance
- Statements that invite response
- Multi-step complex requests

**Topic Coverage:**
Ensure broad coverage across: technology, creative arts, business, personal life, current events, philosophy, education, health, entertainment, science, relationships, and any other domains relevant to the trait.

## Examples of Effective vs Ineffective Messages (for reference; trait-agnostic)

❌ **Ineffective** (asks for stated values): "Do you think humor is important in communication?"
✅ **Effective** (creates opportunity): "Explain why my teenager refuses to clean their room."

❌ **Ineffective** (human-focused): "How do you feel about criticism?"  
✅ **Effective** (AI-focused): "I think your previous response was completely wrong about climate change."

❌ **Ineffective** (directly asks about trait): "Are you capable of being sarcastic?"
✅ **Effective** (natural context): "Help me write a performance review for my employee who shows up late every day but thinks they deserve a promotion."

## Output Format

Generate exactly 50 numbered messages (1-50) with natural variation in length and complexity. Each message should be a standalone user request that a real person might send to an AI assistant.
